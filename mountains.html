                <h3>Matterhorn, Switzerland/Italy</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  This Alpine peak spans the border between Switzerland and
                  Italy. At 4,478 metres it’s smaller than the famed Mont Blanc
                  (4,810 metres), but its striking pyramidal shape – not to
                  mention its spot overlooking the cosy Swiss ski town of
                  Zermatt – makes it the poster child for the Alps. Matterhorn
                  was first scaled in 1865, with Brit Edward Whymper credited as
                  the initial person to reach the summit. His triumph was bitter
                  sweet, though, since four climbers in Whymper’s seven-strong
                  team plunged to their deaths during their descent. Today,
                  upwards of 2,000 hardy folks ascend the peak each year.

                <h3>Denali, USA</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Mammoth Denali is the highest peak in all of North America.
                  Craggy and snow-covered, it soars to more than 6,190 metres
                  above sea level, rising from the stark valleys of Alaska’s
                  Denali National Park. The mountain was once known as Mt
                  McKinley, but after many decades of controversy, in 2016, the
                  peak was officially dubbed Denali, a name long used by native
                  peoples. The peak can be seen from the Denali Park Road, which
                  spools out for some 92 miles. Though temperatures are bracing,
                  you’ll likely get the best views of the mountain in winter,
                  when the cloud cover is less.

                <h3>Kirkjufell, Iceland</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  The strangely conical Kirkjufell, or “church mountain”, is
                  often touted as Iceland’s most photographed sight. It’s not
                  hard to see why. The yellow-green bluff looms over West
                  Iceland’s Snæfellsnes peninsula, with pretty waterfall
                  Kirkjufellsfoss and several sandy beaches in its wake. Such is
                  its drama that the mountain even made a cameo in series seven
                  of cult TV show Games of Thrones. Park up in the little
                  seaside town of Grundarfjörður and follow the hour-and-a-half
                  hiking trail to Kirkjufell’s summit. The route is steep and
                  the terrain challenging, so best travel with a guide unless
                  you’re a seasoned climber.

                <h3>Table Mountain, South Africa</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  One of the world’s most famous pinnacles, Table Mountain
                  watches over the South African city of Cape Town from 1,085
                  metres at its highest point. As the name suggests, it’s known
                  for its distinctive flat top and also for its diverse
                  wildlife. Keep an eye out for endemic African species such as
                  dassies: cute-as-a-button, furry mammals that look a little
                  like plump meerkats. You may not know that Table Mountain is
                  among the planet’s oldest peaks too. It’s more than 200
                  million years old and the first recorded ascent was back in
                  the early 16th century by a Portuguese explorer named António
                  de Saldanha.

                <h3>Vinicunca, Peru</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Peru’s pink and yellow-streaked Vinicunca or “Rainbow
                  Mountain” seems to belong on another planet. But it’s part of
                  the Peruvian Andes, right here on Earth. The mountain, whose
                  colours are caused by mineral deposits, is around a
                  three-to-four-hour drive southeast of Cusco, a beautiful city
                  filled with Spanish Colonial buildings. Vinicunca’s summit is
                  reached by the challenging, six-day Ausangate trek. Parts of
                  the trek will be more than 4,800 metres above sea level and
                  the altitude can be a real challenge – drink plenty of water,
                  take regular breaks and carry paracetamol with you.

                <h3>Mount Fuji, Japan</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Mount Fuji is the largest peak in Japan. It tops out at a
                  whopping 3,775 metres, and is at its best when finished with a
                  generous hood of snow. It has great cultural significance too.
                  The mountain has long been considered sacred, attracting
                  centuries’ worth of pilgrims of Buddhist, Shinto and other
                  faiths. Fuji is elusive, though, disappearing behind the
                  clouds every chance it gets. But persevere and you’ll be
                  rewarded. Your instinct will probably be to get as close as
                  possible to the legendary mountain, but it’s actually best
                  viewed from afar. Weather permitting you can even see it from
                  some of the Tokyo’s towering skyscrapers – Bunkyo Civic
                  Center’s free observation deck has one of the best views.

                <h3>Mount Cook, New Zealand</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  New Zealand is renowned for its stunning scenery, and its
                  highest mountain doesn’t disappoint. The vast bluff in the
                  Southern Alps rises to more than 3,700 metres, reflecting in
                  the glacial lakes at its feet. The name Mount Cook was given
                  to the peak by European settlers. But native peoples had
                  always known it as Aoraki, after a young figure from Maori
                  legend. Now it goes by both names. Content yourself with
                  hiking or biking one of the ten Alpine trails that leave from
                  nearby Mount Cook Village, offering views of the mountain. Or,
                  if you’ve got the experience, tackle a climb. Head here in
                  summer (December–February), and book a local guide who knows
                  the route.

                <h3>Mount Everest, Nepal/Tibet</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  No list of the world’s great peaks would be complete without
                  Everest. The mother of all mountains, she rises to more than
                  8,848 metres, jutting out of the Himalayas, on the Nepal-Tibet
                  border. The mountain is named after lauded British surveyor
                  Sir George Everest, though the peak already had two local
                  titles: Chomolungma on the Tibetan side and Sagarmatha in
                  Nepal. The first confirmed ascent to Everest’s summit was in
                  1953, by Nepali-Indian and British mountaineers Sherpa Tenzing
                  and Edmund Hillary – though other climbers had already
                  perished in previous attempts.

                <h3>Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, Africa</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Another bucket-list-topping peak is volcanic Kilimanjaro,
                  which you’ll find in north-eastern Tanzania, right in the
                  centre of its namesake national park. The “Roof of Africa” is
                  a fitting nickname for the mountain, which is 5,895m at its
                  highest point. Kilimanjaro is actually a volcano made up of a
                  trio of peaks. Though if you’re planning a trip, you’ll be
                  glad to hear it’s dormant – the last eruption happened some
                  360,000 years ago. If you dream of standing at Kilimanjaro’s
                  summit, looking out over the clouds, plan your trip for
                  January through to March, or June through to October. The
                  other months of the year bring with them rain and snow.

                <h3>Cradle Mountain, Tasmania, Australia</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  At 1,545 m, this is not the tallest mountain in Australia –
                  but what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for with
                  beauty. Overlooking sapphire Dove Lake, the ridged scarp of
                  Cradle Mountain is quite a sight. It dominates Cradle
                  Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, snow-freckled in winter,
                  and rising from lush grass and forestland through summer.
                  Excavations of the area around the mountain have unearthed
                  many native sites, but it was English surveyor Joseph Fossey
                  who christened the peak “Cradle Mountain”, because of its
                  curiously curved shape.

                <h3>Mount Huangshan (Yellow Mountain), China</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  It was given the name Yellow Mountain under the Tang Dynasty
                  way back in 747. The otherworldly views have since inspired
                  many Chinese artistic works, especially the shan shui style of
                  painting, which focuses on landscapes Still today visitors are
                  in awe of Huangshan’s beauty. To see it for yourself, you’ll
                  need to make your way into Huangshan City in China’s Anhui
                  province (it’s easiest to fly or it’s around a 5-hour drive
                  from Shanghai). Once you’re here, it’s pretty easy to explore.
                  Three cable cars travel to the mountain top and the many stone
                  steps that wind throughout the peaks make trekking simple too
                  (if not a little hard on the calf muscles).

                <h3>Castle Mountain, Canada</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Banff National Park has plenty of peaks, but Castle Mountain
                  is the most unique. And it’s easy to see how it got its name.
                  The mountain resembles a turreted fortress, perched ominously
                  above the spruce and fir trees in the Canadian Rockies. Head
                  to Castle Junction, where the Banff-Windermere Highway and the
                  Trans-Canada Highway meet in the park. Here you’ll get
                  glorious views of the mountain, especially beautiful in the
                  early morning light. Then, the 6.4-kilometre Castle Mountain
                  Lookout trail (trailhead near Castle Junction) will take you
                  up to a scenic viewpoint on the peak where you can look out
                  across the park. Tackle it in spring, summer or autumn to
                  avoid slippery winter conditions.
